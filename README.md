## About This Repository
I am an aspiring tech professional learning Python and exploring AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science. This repository contains my beginner-level Python practice and projects, created to build strong programming fundamentals through hands-on learning.

## What I’m Learning
- Python basics (variables, data types, operators)
- Conditional statements (if, else, elif)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings
- Basic object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Simple logic-based programs

## Projects Included
- Prime number check
- Palindrome check
- Leap year check
- Largest of three numbers
- Conditional statement programs
- Loop-based practice programs

## Learning Approach
I follow a learning-by-building approach, where I practice concepts by writing simple programs and improving my logic step by step.

## Goal
My goal is to build a strong foundation in Python and gain practical experience through beginner projects while exploring AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science to understand real-world applications.
